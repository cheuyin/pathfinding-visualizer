# Pathfinding Visualizer

I was curious about pathfinding algorithms, and so I coded this web app to visualize them.

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
- Dijkstra's
- A*
- DFS

## Maze Generation Algorithms:
- Recursive backtracking

## Roadmap
In the future, I want to add the following things:
- Prim, Kruskal, and recursive division maze generation algorithm
- Weighted nodes
- Nodes can be traversed diagonally
- Better UI with more explanations of the algorithms and their execution time

## Acknowledgements
I was inspired by [Clement Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer)'s version of this project, and I used his CSS animations because I thought it looked nice and I didn't want to spend too much time on styling.

Aside from that, basically all the code in this project was written from scratch.
